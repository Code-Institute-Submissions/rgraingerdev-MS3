Welcome To the Developer Friends Page, The Developer friends and everything it stands for are the focus of this website. You can find upcoming events, recomendations and the classes.

## Getting Started

Visit https://rgraingerdev.github.io/MSÂ£/ on your preferred web browser to access the Developer friends Page. The website is completely responsive; regardless of whether you're using a desktop computer, tablet or smartphone, it should look excellent on all of them.

## User Storys
I have developed user stories to direct my design and development process; in order to make sure that the Developer friends Page satisfies the requirements of my users. Here are some usage examples for user stories:


* As a developer i want a way to broaden my development skills.
* I want to be able to see events.
* I want to be able to contact somebody if i have questions.
* I want to have access to the most recent Classes.
* I want to learn more about coding.
* i want to be able to easily navigate the website.
* I want to be able to view the webpage on mobile or tablet.


By developing user stories, I can make sure that the website satisfies user needs and offers a satisfying browsing experience. I regularly gather user feedback and apply it to the design and functionality of the website.

## UI/UX

* The aim is for a first-time user to be able to easily navigate.
* The colour scheme was chosen to be easy on the eye and not draw attention away from content. 
* This page was made so that both new and current members can enjoy all things code.

### Future features
* Add a group messageboard for users to ask questions and disscuss together.
* A rolling gallery of images of previous events.
* Add examples and links to past members projects.

### Font

* Inter was the font I chose. The typeface was picked because it is slick and simple for the end user to read, additionally it comes from Google Fonts.
